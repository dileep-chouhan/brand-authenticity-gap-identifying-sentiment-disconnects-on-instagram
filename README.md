# Brand Authenticity Gap: Identifying Sentiment Disconnects on Instagram

## Overview

This project analyzes Instagram data to identify discrepancies between a brand's self-projected image and actual consumer sentiment.  By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, we pinpoint areas where the brand's communication may be misaligned with customer perception. This analysis reveals opportunities for improving brand messaging, enhancing authenticity, and strengthening customer relationships. The project involves data collection (not included in this repository for privacy reasons), pre-processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization of key findings.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* TextBlob (or similar sentiment analysis library)


## How to Run

This project requires Python 3 and several libraries listed above.  To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main analysis script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Note:** This script expects pre-processed data to be present in the `data` directory.  The data used for this project is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.  You will need to replace the placeholder data with your own dataset.  The structure of the input data is described in `data/README.md` (which you should create if you adapt this project).


## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the sentiment analysis to the console, including key statistics such as the overall sentiment score, the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, and specific examples of positive and negative comments.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `top_positive_words.png`, `top_negative_words.png`) in the `output` directory which provide visual representations of the analysis findings. These visualizations help illustrate the sentiment distribution and highlight key themes related to positive and negative customer feedback.
